 * Interpret the p-value and say if it rejects the null hypothesis

_Learn to perform hypothesis testing with Python._

# LEVEL 1

 ## Exercise 1
  - Grab a sports theme dataset you like and select an attribute from the dataset. Calculate the p-value and say if you reject the null hypothesis by taking a 5% alpha.

 # LEVEL 2
  
 ## Exercise 2
  - Continue with the sports theme dataset you like and select two other attributes from the dataset. Calculate the p-values and say if they reject the null hypothesis by taking a 5% alpha.

# LEVEL 3

 ## Exercise 3
 - Continue with the sports theme dataset you like and select three attributes from the dataset. Calculate the p-value and say if you reject the null hypothesis by taking a 5% alpha.
